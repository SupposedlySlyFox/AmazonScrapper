# AmazonScrapper
It's a simple script to scrape Amazon product listings.

# Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
```
npm install express axios jsdom
```
# Start the Server:
Run your Node.js server:
```
node server.js
```
# Access the Webpage:
Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see and use the webpage.


# Q&A
You have to install the dependencies due to github not allowing me to put it down on the files.
There is a slight bug for the reviews that only highlight "Products highlighted as 'Overall Pick' are:" but that's something but it can be improved by using a better script for getting info from the product page, so if theres's something as misleading as it can be considered, it's going to say "No Reviews" so it's only check-able by clicking on the product.
